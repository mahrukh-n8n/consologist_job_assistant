## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- JavaScript over TypeScript (user preference, simpler build pipeline)
- Manifest V3 (MV2 deprecated, Chrome Web Store requires V3)
- chrome.alarms for scheduling (MV3 service worker requirement)
- Field names MUST match reference project exactly (case-sensitive) — critical for n8n compatibility
- alarms permission added proactively in manifest.json to avoid mid-project manifest update when Phase 2 ships
- type:module on service_worker to enable ES module imports from src/utils/ in later phases
- SVG icons used as placeholders to avoid PNG tooling dependency (Chrome accepts SVG in action.default_icon)

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Webhook dependency: n8n must be running for match icons and proposal loading to work during manual testing
- Field name compatibility: all scraped data keys must be verified against reference project before Phase 3 ships
- popup.css referenced in popup.html does not yet exist — Plan 01-02 must create it or remove the reference
